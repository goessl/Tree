# Tree

TreeNode class used to generate & store tree structures.
Every node stores a reference to its parent node, children nodes and its
data.
Every node is also a tree consisting of itself and all of its children.

## Usage

A new node/tree can be constructed with the data it should store.
To every node a child can be added with the add method.
With the getter methods you can get the parent, children and data of every
node.
Also a whole tree can be generated recursively with the constructor or add
method by giving it a growth function. It takes the data of a node and
should return data for its children. This way a complex tree can be
generated with a single function.
